Create a modern, mobile-friendly website for a local web design service called PagePilot.

Brand & Design:
Use a clean, modern layout, but avoid blandness — incorporate soft textures, background shapes, icons, and subtle animations to give it personality.

Use a green-themed color palette (greens, greys, and white) to feel friendly, natural, and local.

Add hover effects, gentle motion (like fade-ins or slide-ups), and icons or illustrations to break up sections visually.

Structure:
If possible, make this a multi-page website with:

Home

About

Pricing

Contact
If Replit cannot support multiple pages, combine it into a smooth-scrolling single page with clearly separated sections.

Homepage:
Hero headline:
"Websites that take off — PagePilot helps local businesses get online fast."

Short intro paragraph:
“We design clean, affordable websites for local businesses — mobile-friendly, fast, and made to reflect your brand.”

Visual: Add an illustration or icon-based image like a monitor or simple animation near the hero section.

Instead of fake stats like "500+ websites", include this honest message:
“Every site is handcrafted with care, tailored to each client — no templates, no shortcuts.”

About Page / Section:
Focus on the personal side:
“We’re a local business, just like you. PagePilot was built to help independent businesses grow online without spending a fortune.”

Quote from the creator:
“I started PagePilot to help local businesses look professional online. Every site I make is handcrafted and made to feel personal.”
