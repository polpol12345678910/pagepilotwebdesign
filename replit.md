# PagePilot - Professional Website Building Service

## Overview

PagePilot is a professional website building service landing page built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a static website designed to showcase web development services, featuring a modern design with smooth animations, responsive navigation, and clean aesthetics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

This is a client-side only static website with no backend services. The architecture follows a simple three-tier frontend structure:

1. **Structure Layer (HTML)**: Semantic HTML5 markup for content organization
2. **Presentation Layer (CSS)**: Modern CSS with custom properties for styling and responsive design
3. **Behavior Layer (JavaScript)**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Landing Page**: Single-page application structure with multiple sections
- **Modern CSS Framework**: Custom CSS using CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks - pure JavaScript for DOM manipulation and user interactions

### Design System
- **Typography**: Inter font family from Google Fonts
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 for consistent iconography
- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue-based palette with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger navigation

### Interactive Features
- **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu with toggle functionality
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Animated navigation between page sections
- **Dynamic Navbar**: Background changes on scroll for better visual hierarchy
- **Contact Form**: Basic form structure (submission handling appears incomplete)

## Data Flow

Since this is a static website, data flow is minimal:

1. **User Interactions**: Click events trigger JavaScript functions
2. **Navigation**: Smooth scrolling to page sections via anchor links
3. **Form Data**: Contact form appears to collect user information (backend integration needed)
4. **Visual Feedback**: CSS transitions and JavaScript provide immediate UI responses

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Version 6.4.0 for icons via CDN

### No Backend Dependencies
- No database connections
- No server-side processing
- No API integrations currently implemented

## Deployment Strategy

### Current State
- **Static Hosting Ready**: Can be deployed to any static hosting service
- **No Build Process**: Direct deployment of HTML/CSS/JS files
- **CDN Dependent**: Relies on external CDNs for fonts and icons

### Recommended Hosting Options
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Traditional web hosting
- AWS S3 static hosting

### Future Considerations
- **Contact Form**: Will need backend service or third-party form handler (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms)
- **Performance**: Consider bundling and minification for production
- **SEO**: Add meta tags, structured data, and sitemap
- **Analytics**: Integration with Google Analytics or similar tracking

### Development Notes
